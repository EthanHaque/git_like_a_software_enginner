## Git Branching Strategies for Fast-Paced Small Teams

Branching strategies define how a team organizes work in Git. For small teams working in rapid development cycles, the key goals are speed, simplicity, and minimizing overhead.

Below are branching strategies well-suited for fast-moving environments, along with tips on implementing them effectively.

### Trunk-Based Development (TBD)

**Overview**:
- All developers work off a single shared branch (usually `main`).
- Feature work is done in short-lived branches that are merged quickly.

**Benefits**:
- Minimal branch management.
- Encourages continuous integration.
- Reduces long-lived conflicts.

**Workflow**:
```bash
# Create a short-lived feature branch
git checkout -b feat/quick-fix

# Make changes, then push and merge ASAP
git add .
git commit -m "fix: correct typo on homepage"
git push origin feat/quick-fix

# Create a PR, get a quick review, and merge to main
```

**Best Practices**:
- Keep branches small and focused.
- Merge within hours or a day at most.
- Use automated tests on `main`.

### Feature Branching (with Short-Lived Branches)

**Overview**:
- Each feature or fix gets its own branch off `main`.
- Merged back via pull requests after review and testing.

**Benefits**:
- Isolates work cleanly.
- Easier collaboration and code review.

**Workflow**:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/add-profile-page
# work, commit, push
git push origin feat/add-profile-page
# open pull request → review → merge
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use clear branch names (`feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`).
- Delete branches after merging.
- Review quickly to avoid stale work.

---

### Release Branches (Optional)

For slightly larger small teams, introducing short-lived release branches can help freeze features before deployment.

**Workflow**:
- Branch from `main` to `release/x.y`.
- Only allow bugfixes or final polish.
- Tag and deploy from this branch.

```bash
git checkout -b release/1.0
# final test and fixes
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0 --tags
```

## Choosing and Implementing a Strategy

1. **Pick Simplicity Over Structure**: Trunk-based development or short-lived feature branching is usually enough.
2. **Automate Testing**: Use CI to run tests on `main` and PRs.
3. **Keep History Clean**: Use squash merges or rebase before merging.
4. **Communicate**: Have clear naming and merge guidelines in a team README or CONTRIBUTING file.

## Alternative Workflows for Larger Teams

While lightweight branching works well for small teams, larger teams often adopt more structured workflows to handle complexity, coordination, and deployment.

### Git Flow

**Overview**:
- Uses multiple long-lived branches: `main`, `develop`, `release`, `hotfix`, and `feature/*`.
- Separates development, release preparation, and production code.
- Clear separation of concerns.
- Ideal for teams with formal QA/release cycles.


### Release Train / Environment-Based Branching

**Overview**:
- Branches for each environment: `develop`, `qa`, `staging`, `prod`.
- Changes move between environments via merges.

> If your team grows, start light (feature branching or GitHub Flow), then evolve as coordination needs increase.
